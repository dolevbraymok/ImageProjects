This project implements pyramid blending, a technique used in image processing to seamlessly blend two images together based on a mask.
The blending process involves creating Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids for the input images and the mask, then combining them using a specified blending formula.
The result is a visually smooth transition between the two images according to the mask.
