This project is a Python script that converts videos into panoramic images.
It processes each frame of the video, stitches them together using panorama stitching algorithms, and produces a panoramic view of the scene captured in the video.

Implementation Method:
The Video is proccessed frame by frame
I used Harris Corner Detection and Gaussian Pyramids to find features
and the used RANSAC to find a homography the fit largest number if features
Lastly warp and stiches images together using the homography found before
